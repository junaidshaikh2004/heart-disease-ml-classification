# Heart Disease Risk Classifier 🫀

This is an **end-to-end machine learning project** that predicts the type of heart disease a person may have, using clinical and demographic features. It is designed to strengthen my understanding of ML workflows—ranging from data cleaning and EDA to handling class imbalance, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Explore and clean real-world heart disease data
- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Build baseline classification models
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
- Evaluate multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Interpret model performance using classification reports and confusion matrices
- Perform feature importance analysis and hyperparameter tuning
- Learn and grow hands-on ML skills through a healthcare-focused use case

## 🧠 Key ML Concepts Applied

- Handling missing data using mean/median/mode based on skewness
- Encoding binary & multiclass categorical variables
- Dealing with class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - R², MAE, RMSE for additional insight
- Feature Importance analysis (XGBoost vs Random Forest)
- Learning to interpret poor model performance in imbalanced settings

## ✅ Status

🟡 **Ongoing Project**  
This project is continuously evolving as I explore more advanced topics such as SHAP explainability, threshold tuning, model ensembling, and deployment using FastAPI or Streamlit.
